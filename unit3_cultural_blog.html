<h1>Fireside Thoughts</h1>
<p>After watching <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shareef's Fireside Chat</a>, I came to realize just how fluid the DBC experience is. Always in motion, always changing. Cohorts come and go, new ideas are born. The experience is what you make of it, which I think is a good thing. This fosters the opportunity for every individual to contribute and leave his or her mark on the course. I like the idea of being able to explore and investigate the things that interest me in regards to programming. This is a very useful environment because it is very conducive to growing ones passion. To me though there are some parts of the environment that make me uneasy.</p>
<p>I am kind of a timid person, especially when I am in situations where my intellect or abilities are coming into question. I feel like I am overly concerned about how others perceive me, thus not asking the questions I have or speaking up because of how I will be judged. This was a huge struggle for me when I was living in Spain and learning Spanish. I didn’t want to sound stupid, so I didn’t practice the language very much at first. Luckily, in that situation, I did get over my shame, and realized that I would make mistakes, but that people would realize I wasn’t from there so it was ok. I think the same will probably happen to me at DBC. I will be a little timid or hesitant at first, but once I become comfortable in my surroundings I will relax and know that everyone is pretty much on the same level as me, therefore losing my shame to help lead and create discussion.</p>

<h1>My Values and Stereotype Threat</h1>
<p>After learning a little bit about stereotype threat, I looked back to my values post to reassess how my values would help me combat any issues I might encounter that regard this threat. My personal values when I started DBC were commitment, inner harmony and challenge. These are the things that I find vital in order to be happy in life.</p>
<p>They relate to how to deal with stereotype threat nicely. First, when I have experienced stereotype threat I have always seen it as a challenge. Rather than back down from this challenge, I like to rise to the occasion and disprove the stereotype that I have been lumped into. This is where I feel commitment relates to the threat.  As long as I stay committed to learn from my experiences and how to handle them moving forward, I feel I can tackle whichever problems or issues are presented to me. Finally, I believe that with these first two parts I can achieve the final part of the equation, which is inner harmony. In order to find this, one needs to be comfortable with who they are and know themselves well. I feel like I know myself pretty well, which enables me to manage my emotions and reduce my levels of stress because I know the things that trigger these types of reactions from me.</p>
<p>When I feel down, usually I try to stay really busy until I feel better. Whether that is really getting into my work, exercising, reading, or something else I try to change my focus to something productive until I feel better. I am pretty methodical about how I manage my time, so I try to stick to a particular routine until my emotions improve. I like to schedule in free time for leisure activities because I feel that in order to stay balanced they are absolutely necessary. Some ways I am anticipating dealing with this in Chicago are reading during my El commute, taking walks at lunch, and also embracing the yoga and meditation that are part of Dev Bootcamp. With these things in my life, I should be able to find a good life balance, even though I will be very busy with work.</p>
