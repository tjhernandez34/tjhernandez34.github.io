   <h2>Tableau loves data.</h2>      
   <h2>I love data.</h2>
   <h2>Let's spread the word.</h2></p>

   <p><h1 class="cover_letter_title">Who am I?</h1></p> 

   <p>I am creator. I am a builder. I am a web developer. I take an idea and run with it. I build apps that serve a purpose, look good, and are easy to use. I understand that in order for an application to be successful form and function are not mutually exclusive. I recognize the difference between forcing a framework to fit a problem, and finding the framework that is best for the problem. I am not afraid of trying new technologies.
   </p>

   <p>However, I am more than a web developer. I am adventurous. I like trying new things and seeing new places. Whether it be traveling to some far off land, or trying exotic foods. I like to learn and experience all that I can. I like photography, I speak Spanish and I love to cook. I have been known to kick back and have a cigar, and I make one hell of a mojito. 
   </p>

   <p>I recently graduated from Dev Bootcamp. I learned more in my time there than I thought was possible. I learned how to be a self-sufficient developer and solve problems quickly and on my own.  I learned the importance of writing readable, maintainable code through the use of testing and encapsulation.
   </p>

   <p>My final project at Dev Bootcamp solved a problem. My group created an algorithm that would parse a human genome and find genetic risk factors for various diseases within that specific genome. We used a Ruby on Rails backend with ActiveRecord, and tied that to a NoSQL database in order to improve speed. It was challenging dealing with such a large dataset and the problems that arise with sending that amount of data across the web. In this project I learned the benefits of NoSQL vs SQL and was able to improve on database design and Ruby.

   <p><span class="italic">Your product brings out my inner nerd.</span> I love data. Ever since I was a child I have been charting statistics and information. As a child it was baseball statistics, as an adult it has been anything reasonable to put in a spreadsheet.  That part of the experience is what makes Tableau so enticing to me. I would enjoy being part of a team that helps companies realize their full potential with the data that is available to them. I'd love to be a part of building solutions to client problems with you.</p>

   <p><span class="italic">I think we should work together.</span> You need someone who is willing to work hard to help your company grow. You need a person that is going to do everything they can to help bring in other skilled people to help Tableau be the best it can be. You need a developer who is willing to learn multiple technologies and be versatile as technology constantly changes. You need someone who wants to grow as an employee as your company grows.</p>

   <p>I'm that person. Shoot me an <a id="email_link" href="mailto:tjhernandez34@gmail.com">email</a> or give me a call (360) 333-0462.</p>
