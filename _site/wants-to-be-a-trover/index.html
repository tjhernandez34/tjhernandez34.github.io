   <p><h1 class="cover_letter_title">Hello, I'm Travis</h1>
   <h2>Trover's purpose inspires me.</h2>      
   <h2>I'm excited about your product.</h2>
   <h2>I would like to contribute.</h2></p>

   <p><h1 class="cover_letter_title">Who am I?</h1></p>

   <p>I am creator. I am a builder. I am a web developer. I take an idea and run with it. I build apps that serve a purpose, look good, and are easy to use. I understand that in order for an application to be successful, form and function are not mutually exclusive. I recognize the difference between forcing a framework to fit a problem, and finding the framework that is best for the problem. I am not afraid of trying new technologies.
   </p>   

   <p>I am also more than a web developer. I am adventurous. I like trying new things and seeing new places. Whether it be traveling to some far off land, or trying exotic foods, I like to learn and experience all that I can. I like photography, I speak Spanish and I love to cook. I have been known to kick back and have a cigar, and I make one mean mojito. 
   </p>   

   <p>I recently graduated from Dev Bootcamp. I learned more in my time there than I thought was possible. I learned how to be a self-sufficient developer and solve problems quickly and on my own.  I learned the importance of writing readable, maintainable code through the use of testing and encapsulation.
   </p>   

   <p>My final project at Dev Bootcamp solved a problem. My group created an algorithm that would parse a human genome and find genetic risk factors for various diseases within that specific genome. We used a Ruby on Rails backend with ActiveRecord, and tied that to a NoSQL database in order to improve speed. It was challenging dealing with such a large dataset and the problems that arise with sending that amount of data across the web. In this project I learned the benefits of NoSQL vs SQL and was able to improve on database design and Ruby.

   <p><h1 class="cover_letter_title">Let's talk about Trover</h1></p>

   <p><span class="italic">You care about what you do.</span> Your website is beautiful. The user interface is intuitive, and it communicates effectively. One thing that is important to me is working with people who care about the quality of their work. Trover's ease of use and its subject matter really gives me an insight into the type of people who are part of your team.</p>

   <p><span class="italic">You inspire dreams.</span> I love to travel. Whenever I get the chance, I encourage others to do so. It doesnâ€™t have to be far; it can be as simple as exploring your own area and seeing the world around you. Your company inspires people to do what I love, and that is something I can put all of my passion behind.</p>

   <p><span class="italic">You foster a great company culture.</span> After reading some of the Trover spotlight articles on your blog, it is clear that you are a company that doesn't just inspire others to travel, but is actually full of travelers. I feel that the culture of a company is one of the most important things for an employee. It is clear that the culture at Trover goes beyond colleagues, and instead is based on friendship.</p>

   <p><span class="italic">I think we should work together.</span> You need someone who is willing to work hard to help your company grow. You need a developer who is willing to learn multiple technologies and be versatile. You need someone who wants to grow as an employee as your company grows.</p>

   <p>I'm that person. Shoot me an <a id="email_link" href="mailto:tjhernandez34@gmail.com">email</a> or give me a call (360) 333-0462.</p>
