<h1>Functional Programming vs. OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)</h1>
<p>These are two terms that are used to describe styles of writing code, and also the languages that are used to write them.  I have been working solely with Ruby, so I understand how an OOP works. I didn’t have any experience with functional programming or their languages, so I decided to delve deeper into that area to really understand the differences.</p>
<h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
<p>This type of programming paradigm uses objects store all of the code for the programming within functions within classes. Then if you want to create a new object of that specific class, you can create it with the variable values you want for that specific object.</p>
<h2>Functional Programming</h2>
<p>If object oriented programming focuses on the use of objects, functional programming does not use them. Instead the variables are all set, so every time you run a code with a specific set of variables you will get the same output. In order to change the output, you have to change the input.</p>
<h2>Baby Boy</h2>
<p>Okay, this is an example of the two different types of programming. These were both performed in Ruby because even though Ruby is and object oriented language, you can use it for functional programming.</p>
<p>These examples are looking at the height of a boy at 7 years old.</p>
<p>OOP Input</p>

<p>Look at that, we got the same answer both times. However, in this case the OOP code can be much more versatile if you want to find the height of a different boy at a different age. This is because when you create a new baby boy, you can set their height at birth. Whereas, he functional programming would need to have its preset variable values changed within the code before you could get a different output.</p>

<h1>Ruby Basics: Classes</h1>
<p>This week for my technical blog I am going to talk about classes. What are classes? How do we use them? What are the different parts of them used for? These are some of the questions that I will be addressing in this lesson.</p>
 
<p>Okay, imagine you are thinking about going from New York City to Los Angeles, and you want to see how long it would take in different types of vehicle. Well, this is where we can use a class.</p>
 
<p>First, let’s create a class named transportation.</p>
 
<img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2805/13804048344_461c200af8_z.jpg">
 
<p>Then we want to make a method within the class that will initialize the process. Normally, the initialize method is where you name your variables and set constants for your equation.</p>
 
<img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3817/13804048104_b95839219a_z.jpg">
 
<p>In this case, the initialize method takes two parameters: the mode of transportation (as a string) and the average speed (as an integer). Then we use the @ sign to make set the variables as instance variables. Instance variables can only be accessed from within the class they exist, and also within the different methods of that class, as we will see later. The last part of initialize is the distance between New York and LA, which we will use in later parts of the class.</p>
 
<p>Next, we define a method named cross_country. This method will calculate the hours it will take to travel from one city to the other by the particular form of transportation you are referencing. Here is how I have created the equation. Hours is equal to the distance from New York to LA divided by the average speed. You will notice the to_f that follows these two sides of the equation. To_f changes the integers that we entered for average speed and distance to floating point numbers (numbers with a decimal point). This is done to give a more exact answer for some of the times that will be returned later. At the end of this we put a string that will read “"It is X miles from New York to Los Angeles. It would take X hours to travel from New York to Los Angeles by MODE. That is, if you don't stop..."</p>
 
<img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2824/13804047994_0032f178e2_z.jpg">
 
<p>Now for the fun part, let’s create some new types of transportation for our transportation class.</p>
 
<img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7161/13804048044_47563aa528_z.jpg">
 
<p>We have made a few different types with varying speeds, but our program still doesn’t give you any output. We have only created objects than now exist within our class. In order to perform the calculations we want, we must call the cross_country method on each of them, like so.</p>
 
<img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7083/13804047684_b686f4afa0_z.jpg">
 
<p>Now, we can see the outputs. You could expand on the methods here to give you more exact answers days, hours, minutes, and seconds, but for the scope of this explanation I will leave you with floating point numbers that this returns.</p>

<p>Here's the output!</p>

<h1>Ruby Basics: Enumerable#Map</h1>
<p>Enumerable#map can be used on an array or a collection of data. It iterates through the data with what is contained in the block or parenthesis following the .map, then returns a new array with the new outputs from running the code on the data you are trying to manipulate.</p>
<p>For example, say we have an array of ways to say “Hello” in different languages. We want to make sentences that say “Hello Joe” with the different languages presented in the array.</p>
<p>First, we create the array.</p>
<img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7139/13635697193_4fc9c4dc4c_z.jpg">
<p>Next, we call the Enumerable#map on the greetings array that we have created.</p>
<img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2873/13635680325_776d902819_z.jpg">
<p>Then, we write the block of code we want to be applied to the data contained in the greetings array.</p>
<img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3694/13635680375_938cd24468_z.jpg">
<p>Finally, this is what the output of the new array will look like from running this code.</p>
<img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3733/13636028664_48063cb7b6_z.jpg">
<p>That is how Enumerable#map works. There are a few different ways you can write the syntax for this, so below I have included some variations of the syntax and some other examples of how you can use this to manipulate the data collection you are running it on.</p>
