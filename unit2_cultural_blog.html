<h1>My Experiences with Stereotype Threat</h1>
<p>Fortunately, I have not had to deal with stereotype threat very much in my life. However, for the past two years as an ex-pat everything I did was surrounded by stereotype threat. The stereotype threat that I felt was being an American, or in my case from the United States (American can apply to more than just people from the United States in many languages). Everyone has their idea of what Americans are like. This is usually due to the media that they have been exposed to that is created by the United States. This comes in the form of movies, television series, and music. The United States is really good at exporting culture.</p>
<p>Through travelling I have really had to downplay all of my Americaness just so I could fit in better and not have people stare at me. Sticking out (in a bad way) does make me feel anxious, so I made a note to try and avoid it when possible. Then after a while, I began to notice I would judge other Americans based on the stereotypes I know we all have when I would see them in public places. Here is a list of things that many Americans don't know will make them standout in Europe:</p>
<ol>
  <li>We dress for the weather, not for the season. For example, a 80 degree spring day is not weather for shorts.</li>
  <li>Our voices carry.</li>
  <li>We pet others' dogs in public.</li>
  <li>We eat a snack or drink coffee on the go.</li>
  <li>We occassionally wear sweatpants in public.</li>
  <li>We wear sandals when not at the beach.</li>
  <li>Sometimes when someone doesn’t understand us(because they don’t speak English) we repeat what we just said, but louder.</li>
  <li>We like to order food how we want it, not how it comes.</li>
</ol>
<p>This list is things that Europeans don’t do, but Americans do. To most people on vacation these types of things wouldn’t matter, but when you know other people are judging you if you do these types of things, you don’t do them. They made me very self-conscious and I would try really hard not to do these things.
Not all of the stereotype threat is like this, some other examples I have encountered are less about how Americans are and more about pre-conceived notions of how Americans should be.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of my experiences with this type of stereotype threat:</p>

<p>“You see children, Travis is not a normal American because he is thin…”-from one of the other teachers, while I was teaching English</p>

<p>“You look so American today… You always have a coffee in your hand…”</p>
<p>These two were funny more than anything, they did not really make me upset or self-conscious in any way.</p>
<p>“Ok, now at this mosque if anyone asks… you’re German, not American”</p>
<p>This one was eye opening because no one is comfortable in any situation where they cannot be themselves, plus this had an added sense of danger.</p>
<p>These last two really irritated me…</p>
<p>This one came from a German woman while walking the Camino de Santiago.</p>
<p>“Oh… so you’re Americans, you must have seen <em>The Way</em>…”</p>
<p>For those of you who don’t know what the Camino de Santiago is, it is a pilgrimage to Santiago in Spain, and the movie The Way is a movie about this that came out a couple years ago in the US. It’s a real tearjerker and I would recommend it.</p>
<p>This final gem came from a Belgian girl I met in Portugal.</p>
<p>“Do you even speak a second language?”</p>
<p>These made me become really defensive and made me feel like I had to justify everything.</p>
 
<p>The point of all of this is that as an American you get pigeonholed by people just purely because of where you are from. I plan on not making assumptions, trying my best, and being forthright in everything I do and say to people. I think that these three things will create environments in which no one will feel stereotype threat. As far as giving and asking for feedback, I think that if you don’t sugar-coat, yet still present your feedback in a respectful way then that will be the best way to combat stereotype threat. Sometimes, when someone is critical of you it makes you feel insecure or upset, at this point one needs to remind himself to not take it personally, and use it to grow. In order to prevent these situations from arising I think I will be myself, and be friendly and respectful to everyone, just like how everyone should act.</p>

<h1>Issues In Tech</h1>
<p>For 2014, one of the biggest issues facing the tech industry is the US Supreme Court case of Alice Corp v. CLS Bank. Even though everyone has heard of this landmark case, I am going to give you a summary of what it is about and what is at stake. Then I will discuss some of the implications of the various outcomes and what this would mean for the tech industry as a whole.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This case regards patent infringement. Alice Corp owns the patents for a handful of computer programs and electronic processes centered on financial trading systems. Alice Corp applied for these patents between 1992 and 2005 and they were finally issued between 1999 and 2010. In 2002, CLS Bank began using a similar software program to the ones Alice Corp holds patents for. The patents contain abstract ideas of how to facilitate the process of reducing risk for financial transactions and then the programs written in order to carry-out this system. Alice Corp found out about the violations and notified CLS Bank that they were infringing on the patents, and discussed licensing the software and systems to CLS Bank.</p>
<p>In 2007, CLS Bank sued Alice Corp in one of the lower levels of the US court system. They claimed that the patents held by Alice Corp were invalid and not enforceable. Alice Corp then countersued CLS Bank claiming that they had violated the patents they held. CLS Bank won this hearing, the court found that the patent held abstract ideas on “risk management”, that anyone in business or finance would know and that the program only electronically facilitated carrying out the ideas of risk management. Therefore they weren’t eligible for patents under 35 U.S.C. § 101.</p>
<p>Alice Corp later appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and had the earlier ruling overturned. CLS Bank filed a petition of appeal in the US Court of Appeals, and this overturned the courts’ prior ruling. This resulted in the court wanting to answer a few questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What test should the court use to determine if a computer based program is a patent-ineligible abstract idea?</li>
  <li>Will the presence of a computer in a claim eventually make the patent-ineligible material patentable?</li>
  <li>Should method, system, and media claim be equal under 35 U.S.C. § 101?</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, this leads to today with the US Supreme Court. The court has set out to answer this question: "Whether claims to computer-implemented inventions—including claims to systems and machines, processes, and items of manufacture—are directed to patent-eligible subject matter within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. § 101." Essentially, does the computer program you wrote, do something that people in a specific field view as common knowledge or a common goal.</p>
<h2>What is at stake and what are the implications?</h2>
<p>The main thing that is at stake is companies’ ability to create new, innovative products without threat of legal recourse. Lots of companies hold patents to various ideas even though they don’t have a product to go with the idea. This can lead to litigation for software companies because if have a similar idea and develop it, they will be susceptible to be sued. On the other, large companies that hold many patents are concerned that if the courts rule against Alice Corp, their patents might become invalid, creating lots of competition where before there was none.
It is also interesting to note that some of the major technology players, such as Google, Microsoft, IBM, Verizon, and HP, have filed friend of the court briefs for one of the two companies involved in the suit. All of the companies listed here, aside from IBM, are in support of CLS Bank.
In my opinion, I think it will be best if the court sides with CLS Bank. I think that this is an important action because if they end up siding with Alice Corp I feel it will stifle innovation and progress. However, I believe the court will find some middle-ground between the two sides in order to ensure patents are respected, but more so for the hardware and physical aspect of the tech industry (gadgets and such). This would keep the flow of new technology open and yet still allow firms to maintain ownership of the delivery devices for the programs.</p>

<h1>Emotional Conflict</h1>
<p>The last time I had a serious emotional conflict with someone was about a year ago. I look back on this one and kind of laugh because it was almost like a break-up, but with a co-worker. Anyways, I was working at a school in Spain. One of my coworkers, we will call him Juan, had slowly become one of my friends. He was still a coworker, but the kind of coworker where you joke around at work and then never see them outside of work. He would give me a ride to the school every day, along with the other non-Spaniards who taught English like I did.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, he would be late to pick us up or go in early, so we would end up taking the bus. One day, this happened, so we went to school like normal. Then as the day went on, he never came to work. Eventually, one of the other teachers told us that he sprained his ankle, so he wouldn’t be coming in that day. The next day came and went, same thing. The teachers told us he would be in by the end of the week.</p>
<p>As the days came and went he still was out with a sprained ankle. Then as days turned to a weeks, the staff informed us that he would be out for about 6 weeks with his ankle sprain. A couple of weeks after the accident, I sent him a text to see how he was doing. I didn’t get a response until two weeks later. He said he was feeling better and had just finished rehab, then went on to say he was really disappointed with me, but we could talk more after spring break when he came back to work. </p>
<p>Once he came back to work, he explained that he waited the two weeks to text me back because I had waited two weeks to text him. Then said that he didn’t want to be friends anymore and go to a colleagues-only relationship. He also said that he would no longer be giving the English language assistants a ride to work because he just wasn’t interested in doing it anymore. I told him I was sorry for hurting his feelings, and that if I knew it would be like this I would have contacted him sooner. I told him I respected his decision and that it was his decision to make, but if he ever felt differently I would still like to be friends. We shook hands and that was that. </p>
<p>Some things irritated me about this whole thing. First, I did not like how he was punishing the other English teachers for a conflict between him and me. Second, I did not like how he rescinded his statement of not giving the other English teachers a ride, by selectively giving, ones whom he wanted to, a ride to work. Essentially, punishing the ones whom I was closest with. </p>
<p>Looking back on this situation about a year removed, I would say my actions did not help the situation, but they also did not worsen it. If I could go back, I would send him a message to ask how he was doing and then we would probably still be friends. I think I learned a lot from this situation. I learned how different two cultures can be and what the social norms are. Even in the US, one should reasonably expect to get a how are you doing text if something happens to them, so that was my bad for not doing that. However, an American who sprains their ankle is not going to miss 6 weeks of work to recover. Maybe two days, maybe, unless your job requires you to be walking around, carrying things all day long. Teaching can be done from crutches, so I don’t want to give a pity party to someone that seems to be milking something for all it’s worth. </p>
<p>I don’t have conflict all that often in my life, aside from the occasional disagreement with my girlfriend, but this conflict is one that still sticks with me and I have learned that sometimes people just need a small gesture of kindness and then they will be happy.</p>
