         <p id="second">I am creator. I am a builder. I am a web developer. I take an idea and run with it. I build apps that serve a purpose, look good, and are easy to use. I understand that in order for an application to be successful form and function are not mutually exclusive. I recognize the difference between forcing a framework to fit a problem, and finding the framework that is best for the problem. I am not afraid of trying new technologies.

         <p id="third">However, I am more than a web developer. I am adventurous. I like trying new things and seeing new places. Whether it be traveling to some far off land, or trying exotic foods. I like to learn and experience all that I can. I like photography, I speak Spanish and I love to cook. I have been known to kick back and have a cigar, and I make one hell of a mojito.

         <p id="fourth">I recently graduated from Dev Bootcamp. I learned more in my time there than I thought was possible. I learned how to be a self-sufficient developer and solve problems quickly and on my own.  I learned the importance of writing readable, maintainable code through the use of testing and encapsulation.

         <p id="fifth">My final project at Dev Bootcamp solved a problem. My group created an algorithm that would parse a human genome and find genetic risk factors for various diseases within that specific genome. We used a Ruby on Rails backend with ActiveRecord, and tied that to a NoSQL database in order to improve speed. It was challenging dealing with such a large dataset and the problems that arise with sending that amount of data across the web. In this project I learned the benefits of NoSQL vs SQL and was able to improve on database design and Ruby.

          <p id="eighth"><span class="italic">You inspire dreams.</span> I love to travel. Whenever I get the chance, I encourage others to do so. It doesnâ€™t have to be far, it can be as simple as exploring your own area and seeing the world around you. Your company inspires people to do what I love, and that is something I can put all of my passion behind.</p>

         <p id="ninth"><span class="italic">You foster a great company culture.</span> After reading some of the Trover spotlight articles on your blog, it is clear that you are a company that doesn't just inspire others to travel, but is full of travelers. I feel that the culture of a company is one of the most important things for an employee. It is clear that the culture at Trover goes beyond colleagues, and instead is based on friendship.</p>

         <p id="tenth"><span class="italic">I think we should work together.</span> You need someone who is willing to work hard to help your company grow. You need a developer who is willing to learn multiple technologies and be versatile. You need someone who wants to grow as an employee as your company grows.</p>
