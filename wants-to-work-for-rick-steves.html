   <p><h1 class="cover_letter_title">Hello, I'm Travis.</h1>
   <h2>Rick Steves' purpose inspires me.</h2>      
   <h2>I'm excited about your product.</h2>
   <h2>I would like to contribute.</h2></p>

   <p><h1 class="cover_letter_title">Who am I?</h1></p>

   <p>I am a creator. I am a builder. I am a web developer. I take an idea and run with it. I build apps that serve a purpose, look good, and are easy to use. I understand that in order for an application to be successful, form and function are not mutually exclusive. I recognize the difference between forcing a framework to fit a problem, and finding the framework that is best for the problem. I am not afraid of trying new technologies.
   </p>   

   <p>I am also more than a web developer. I am adventurous. I like trying new things and seeing new places. Whether it be traveling to some far off land, or trying exotic foods, I like to learn and experience all that I can. I like photography, I speak Spanish and I love to cook. I have been known to kick back and have a cigar, and I make one mean mojito. 
   </p>   

   <p>I recently graduated from Dev Bootcamp. I learned more in my time there than I thought was possible. I learned how to be a self-sufficient developer and solve problems quickly and on my own.  I learned the importance of writing readable, maintainable code through the use of testing and encapsulation.
   </p>   

   <p>My final project at Dev Bootcamp solved a problem. My group created an algorithm that would parse a human genome and find genetic risk factors for various diseases within that specific genome. We used a Ruby on Rails backend with ActiveRecord, and tied that to a NoSQL database in order to improve speed. It was challenging dealing with such a large dataset and the problems that arise with sending that amount of data across the web. In this project I learned the benefits of NoSQL vs SQL and was able to improve on database design and Ruby.

   <p><span class="italic">You care about what you do.</span> </p>

   <p><span class="italic">You inspire dreams.</span> I love to travel. Whenever I get the chance, I encourage others to do so. It doesnâ€™t have to be far; it can be as simple as exploring your own area and seeing the world around you. Your company inspires people to do what I love, and that is something I can put all of my passion behind. I would love to give my all to help a company whose purpose I stand for grow and continue to inspire others.</p>

   <p><span class="italic">You foster a great company culture.</span> </p>

   <p><span class="italic">I think we should work together.</span> You need someone who is willing to work hard to help your company grow. You need a developer who is willing to learn multiple technologies and be versatile. You need someone who wants to grow as an employee as your company grows.</p>

   <p>I'm that person. Shoot me an <a id="email_link" href="mailto:tjhernandez34@gmail.com">email</a> or give me a call (360) 333-0462.</p>
