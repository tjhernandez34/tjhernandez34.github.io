         <p id="second">I am creator. I am a builder. I am a web developer. I take an idea and run with it. I build apps that serve a purpose, look good, and are easy to use. I understand that in order for an application to be successful form and function are not mutually exclusive. I recognize the difference between forcing a framework to fit a problem, and finding the framework that is best for the problem. I am not afraid of trying new technologies.

         <p id="third">However, I am more than a web developer. I am adventurous. I like trying new things and seeing new places. Whether it be traveling to some far off land, or trying exotic foods. I like to learn and experience all that I can. I like photography, I speak Spanish and I love to cook. I have been known to kick back and have a cigar, and I make one hell of a mojito.

         <p id="fourth">I recently graduated from Dev Bootcamp. I learned more in my time there than I thought was possible. I learned how to be a self-sufficient developer and solve problems quickly and on my own.  I learned the importance of writing readable, maintainable code through the use of testing and encapsulation.

         <p id="fifth">My final project at Dev Bootcamp solved a problem. My group created an algorithm that would parse a human genome and find genetic risk factors for various diseases within that specific genome. We used a Ruby on Rails backend with ActiveRecord, and tied that to a NoSQL database in order to improve speed. It was challenging dealing with such a large dataset and the problems that arise with sending that amount of data across the web. In this project I learned the benefits of NoSQL vs SQL and was able to improve on database design and Ruby.
