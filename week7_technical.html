<h1>SQL Issues: SQL Injection</h1>
<p>SQL Injection is a way of exploiting web applications using SQL databases by inserting new SQL command lines into the existing SQL command lines through the web application, where the user can enter fields of text to be uploaded to the SQL database. The inserted lines are then run through the normal sequence of the current SQL. This enables the attacker to run whichever command line SQL queries that they want through the web application of the SQL database.</p>
<p>This creates a huge problem because SQL commands are considered safe by most security models of websites. This allows an attacker to change or manipulate the queries being run by the program, which can alter or even destroy the SQL data that is contained within the table being accessed. In worst case scenarios, this technique will give attackers access to confidential or sensitive information; social security numbers, etc.
A few ways that you can prevent SQL Injection from occurring are as follows:</p>
<p>-A programmer can set very specific parameters for the data that is being input, ie length, type, syntax.</p>
<p>-Provide users of the SQL database the lowest level of security clearance within the system, and also only allow a specific user to access the specific application that they are using rather than access to the entire system.</p>
<p>-Following this, disable all stored procedures when they are not in use.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the differences at two main types of Query Languages, SQL and NoSQL.</p>
<img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2903/14017653181_4c88bf6c3f_z.jpg"/>
<p>I feel like I would prefer to be working with SQL databases because their structure seems more rigid, and therefore I would imagine it is easier to maintain and use. The NoSQL databases seem a little bit more abstract and versatile, but with these two attributes comes less defined rules, which to me means less clear ways to fix problems that arise with the structure you have created. Another reason I am more interested in using SQL Databases is because I just see a lot more practicality in them. Most of the data we use and view is in tables, and they have the same attributes for each individual occurrence. Therefore, I would prefer to work with something I can see myself not only understanding better, but using frequently.</p>
<h3>Query Optimization</h3>
<p>When addressing the problem of query optimization for large data sets, there are a few tips and tricks that one can use to relieve pressures put on the system. Each table item should have a unique ID specific to that line, when you run a query on a particular group, you can save that output which corresponds to the query for that data set, then when your data increases you can run a query on the additional data and add it to the previous query. This prevents the query from retracing through a dataset that it has already created an answer for. This enables the program to finish faster and take up less computational resources on the server. Another way to avoid stressing the system is to use constants in your queries, this enables the computer to bypass the need to scan every individual item searching for matching text, values, etc.</p>

<h1>Functional Programming vs. OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)</h1>
<p>These are two terms that are used to describe styles of writing code, and also the languages that are used to write them.  I have been working solely with Ruby, so I understand how an OOP works. I didn’t have any experience with functional programming or their languages, so I decided to delve deeper into that area to really understand the differences.</p>
<h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
<p>This type of programming paradigm uses objects store all of the code for the programming within functions within classes. Then if you want to create a new object of that specific class, you can create it with the variable values you want for that specific object.</p>
<h2>Functional Programming</h2>
<p>If object oriented programming focuses on the use of objects, functional programming does not use them. Instead the variables are all set, so every time you run a code with a specific set of variables you will get the same output. In order to change the output, you have to change the input.</p>
<h2>Baby Boy</h2>
<p>Okay, this is an example of the two different types of programming. These were both performed in Ruby because even though Ruby is and object oriented language, you can use it for functional programming.</p>
<p>These examples are looking at the height of a boy at 7 years old.</p>
<p>OOP Input</p>
<img href="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7388/13938264564_c8d493e9c9_z.jpg"/>
<p>OOP Output</p>
<img href="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3690/13914717422_9252d3d8d0_z.jpg"/>
<p>Functional Input</p>
<img href="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3685/13914717562_4140791fa3_z.jpg"/>
<p>Functional Output</p>
<img href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5306/13914719831_0b774220c4_z.jpg"/>
<p>Look at that, we got the same answer both times. However, in this case the OOP code can be much more versatile if you want to find the height of a different boy at a different age. This is because when you create a new baby boy, you can set their height at birth. Whereas, he functional programming would need to have its preset variable values changed within the code before you could get a different output.</p>

<h1>Ruby Basics: Classes</h1>
<p>This week for my technical blog I am going to talk about classes. What are classes? How do we use them? What are the different parts of them used for? These are some of the questions that I will be addressing in this lesson.</p>
 
<p>Okay, imagine you are thinking about going from New York City to Los Angeles, and you want to see how long it would take in different types of vehicle. Well, this is where we can use a class.</p>
 
<p>First, let’s create a class named transportation.</p>
 
<img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2805/13804048344_461c200af8_z.jpg">
 
<p>Then we want to make a method within the class that will initialize the process. Normally, the initialize method is where you name your variables and set constants for your equation.</p>
 
<img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3817/13804048104_b95839219a_z.jpg">
 
<p>In this case, the initialize method takes two parameters: the mode of transportation (as a string) and the average speed (as an integer). Then we use the @ sign to make set the variables as instance variables. Instance variables can only be accessed from within the class they exist, and also within the different methods of that class, as we will see later. The last part of initialize is the distance between New York and LA, which we will use in later parts of the class.</p>
 
<p>Next, we define a method named cross_country. This method will calculate the hours it will take to travel from one city to the other by the particular form of transportation you are referencing. Here is how I have created the equation. Hours is equal to the distance from New York to LA divided by the average speed. You will notice the to_f that follows these two sides of the equation. To_f changes the integers that we entered for average speed and distance to floating point numbers (numbers with a decimal point). This is done to give a more exact answer for some of the times that will be returned later. At the end of this we put a string that will read “"It is X miles from New York to Los Angeles. It would take X hours to travel from New York to Los Angeles by MODE. That is, if you don't stop..."</p>
 
<img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2824/13804047994_0032f178e2_z.jpg">
 
<p>Now for the fun part, let’s create some new types of transportation for our transportation class.</p>
 
<img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7161/13804048044_47563aa528_z.jpg">
 
<p>We have made a few different types with varying speeds, but our program still doesn’t give you any output. We have only created objects than now exist within our class. In order to perform the calculations we want, we must call the cross_country method on each of them, like so.</p>
 
<img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7083/13804047684_b686f4afa0_z.jpg">
 
<p>Now, we can see the outputs. You could expand on the methods here to give you more exact answers days, hours, minutes, and seconds, but for the scope of this explanation I will leave you with floating point numbers that this returns.</p>

<p>Here's the output!</p>

<h1>Ruby Basics: Enumerable#Map</h1>
<p>Enumerable#map can be used on an array or a collection of data. It iterates through the data with what is contained in the block or parenthesis following the .map, then returns a new array with the new outputs from running the code on the data you are trying to manipulate.</p>
<p>For example, say we have an array of ways to say “Hello” in different languages. We want to make sentences that say “Hello Joe” with the different languages presented in the array.</p>
<p>First, we create the array.</p>
<img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7139/13635697193_4fc9c4dc4c_z.jpg">
<p>Next, we call the Enumerable#map on the greetings array that we have created.</p>
<img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2873/13635680325_776d902819_z.jpg">
<p>Then, we write the block of code we want to be applied to the data contained in the greetings array.</p>
<img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3694/13635680375_938cd24468_z.jpg">
<p>Finally, this is what the output of the new array will look like from running this code.</p>
<img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3733/13636028664_48063cb7b6_z.jpg">
<p>That is how Enumerable#map works. There are a few different ways you can write the syntax for this, so below I have included some variations of the syntax and some other examples of how you can use this to manipulate the data collection you are running it on.</p>

<h1>Ruby Basics: Arrays v. Hashes</h1>
<p>This week for the technical blog post I am going to be focusing on Ruby. Not only that, but I am going to breakdown for you the dynamics of arrays and hashes. I will go over what they are, what they are good for and how to determine which one to use. Also, I will explain a strategy to help you make the decision of which to implement into your code.</p>
<h3>Arrays</h3>
<p>In a nutshell, an array is a collection of objects. These objects can be strings, integers, etc. The thing that makes an array useful is that it acts as a storage system, that you can call the data contained within based on its numerical position in the array. For example:</p>
<img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7225/13491397933_8064f39aac_z.jpg">
<p>For example, by calling array[0]; you will be able to access the first value in the array, in this case "Joe". It is important to remember, that the position values start counting from 0 and not 1. Arrays are ideal for storing unordered, single pieces of information.</p>
<h3>Hashes</h3>
<p>Hashes, although similar to arrays, are different in a few respects. First, let’s talk about their similarities. Hashes, like arrays, are used to store data, which you can access from outside the hash. However, unlike arrays, hashes use an unordered system of key-value pairings. Then, in order to access the values, you call the information based on the key rather than a numerical place.</p>
<img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3769/13491614703_3a05a17894_z.jpg">
<h3>All This is Great, But Which Do I Use?</h3>
<p>First, you should look at what information you are trying to store.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Does my data need order?</li>
  <li>Does it have one or two levels of information?</li>
  <li>Do I have a lot of information I need to access easily?</li>
</ol>
<p>Then from this, based on the descriptions above, I bet you can determine if you need a hash or an array. If your data needs order, you need an array. If you have a lot of data, coming up with an ordering system will make it easier to access later, so you would also need an array. If you only have one level of information, array. If you have two levels, you should use a hash, unless you need the data to have a specific order, then you could create an array. Basically, arrays can be much more useful for larger pieces of data, but if you only need a small two-leveled piece of information, then a hash is more than sufficient.</p>

<h1>Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</h1>
<p>JavaScript is so popular in web development for many reasons. The JavaScript language is intended to be used to allow interaction between the user and the website. It uses various processes to make the user experience simpler and therefore more enjoyable. JavaScript has a myriad of applications within modern websites, from autocomplete of searches to telling you your password is incorrect without having to reload the page.</p>
<p>JavaScript can also solve problems that arising when different computers try to access the same webpage. Some computers might load the page and have it look different because of the internet browser they are using. JavaScript can solve this problem by analyzing the browser settings and projecting an image that is clear and organized on the user’s computer. The list of uses could go on and on, but the reason that JavaScript is the most popular web languages for this type of development is that it is one of the easiest to learn in comparison to the others. This creates widespread usage, ultimately adding to its popularity.</p>

<h1>Website Review</h1>
<p>The websites I decided to review are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>http://www.lonelyplanet.com/</li>
  <li>http://www.bbc.co.uk/</li>
  <li>http://www.friendsofhabanos.com/</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't use too many websites on a daily basis, but these are three that I constantly find myself logging into when I have time to kill or need to take a mental break from what I am doing.</p>
<p>These sites are my favorites based on content. I am very interested in travel and constantly planning my next adventure, so Lonely Planet is an obvious choice. They constantly are updating their website to include new articles about far and distant places, which is right up my alley. The BBC is one of my favorites because I enjoy reading the news. I feel like the BBC provides enough of a neutral opinion on American politics (as opposed to CNN or Fox News) and also includes a lot of international stories that most US news providers neglect to cover. Also, their features and analysis section is great!</p>
<p>The final site I selected is Friends of Habanos, which is an Australian based Cuban cigar forum and shop. The guys are entertaining, its light-hearted, and they have lots of non-cigar related sections such as 'food', 'arts', 'fishing', etc.</p>
<p>All three websites draw you in initially with a large image as the center of the homepage. Lonely Planet's homepage is one image, unitl you scroll down to reveal the articles. The BBC's is a top story and FOH is a cigar review. I wouldn't call this area that the three have front and center the most important part of any of the sites.</p>
<p>5 Adjectives for each site:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lonely Planet</li>
  <ul>
    <li>simple</li>
    <li>windows8ish???</li>
    <li>graphic(not in a bad way)</li>
    <li>enticing</li>
    <li>modern</li>
  </ul>
  <li>BBC</li>
  <ul>
    <li>cluttered</li>
    <li>overwhelming</li>
    <li>disorganized</li>
    <li>unituitive</li>
    <li>interesting</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Friends of Habanos</li>
  <ul>
    <li>simple</li>
    <li>colorful</li>
    <li>clear</li>
    <li>engaging</li>
    <li>smokey ;)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>On all three sites, it is easy to find what you are looking for on the homepage, however with the BBC site you will have ot read in order to find it. It is easy on all three sites off of the homepage.</p>
<p>It is easy to find what you need on the sites, and after being on the sites I feel like I got the information I needed in a timely matter.</p>
<p>Both Lonely Planet and Friends of Habanos sell products on their site. I have purchsed from both. Lonely Planet has gotten my business mainly because of sales they have had (buy one get one free), but otherwise I probably would have purchased the books from Amazon. Friends of Habanos sells cigars, but unlike most online purchases this is a very person to person oriented service, initiated through a chat box with one of the people that works in the shop in Brisbane. Then you can lay out what you are looking for and they can hand select a box for you that fits your needs. Wonderful to do business with</p>
