<title>My First Blog Post</title>
<p>The websites I decided to review are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>http://www.lonelyplanet.com/</li>
	<li>http://www.bbc.co.uk/</li>
	<li>http://www.friendsofhabanos.com/</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't use too many websites on a daily basis, but these are three that I constantly find myself logging into when I have time to kill or need to take a mental break from what I am doing.</p>
<p>These sites are my favorites based on content. I am very interested in travel and constantly planning my next adventure, so Lonely Planet is an obvious choice. They constantly are updating their website to include new articles about far and distant places, which is right up my alley. The BBC is one of my favorites because I enjoy reading the news. I feel like the BBC provides enough of a neutral opinion on American politics (as opposed to CNN or Fox News) and also includes a lot of international stories that most US news providers neglect to cover. Also, their features and analysis section is great!</p>
<p>The final site I selected is Friends of Habanos, which is an Australian based Cuban cigar forum and shop. The guys are entertaining, its light-hearted, and they have lots of non-cigar related sections such as 'food', 'arts', 'fishing', etc.</p>
<p>All three websites draw you in initially with a large image as the center of the homepage. Lonely Planet's homepage is one image, unitl you scroll down to reveal the articles. The BBC's is a top story and FOH is a cigar review. I wouldn't call this area that the three have front and center the most important part of any of the sites.</p>

<p>On all three sites, it is easy to find what you are looking for on the homepage, however with the BBC site you will have ot read in order to find it. It is easy on all three sites off of the homepage.</p>
<p>It is easy to find what you need on the sites, and after being on the sites I feel like I got the information I needed in a timely matter.</p>
<p>Both Lonely Planet and Friends of Habanos sell products on their site. I have purchsed from both. Lonely Planet has gotten my business mainly because of sales they have had (buy one get one free), but otherwise I probably would have purchased the books from Amazon. Friends of Habanos sells cigars, but unlike most online purchases this is a very person to person oriented service, initiated through a chat box with one of the people that works in the shop in Brisbane. Then you can lay out what you are looking for and they can hand select a box for you that fits your needs. Wonderful to do business with</p>
