   <p><h1 class="cover_letter_title">Hello, I'm Travis.</h1> 
   <h2>Here's my haiku for you:</h2>
   <br>
   <h2>I'm well versed in geek</h2>      
   <h2>Yet, I also speak human.</h2>
   <h2>Let's find time to meet.</h2></p>

   <p><h1 class="cover_letter_title">Who am I?</h1></p>

   <p>I am a creator. I am a builder. I am a web developer. I take an idea and run with it. I build apps that serve a purpose, look good, and are easy to use. I understand that in order for an application to be successful, form and function are not mutually exclusive. I recognize the difference between forcing a framework to fit a problem, and finding the framework that is best for the problem. I am not afraid of trying new technologies.
   </p>   

   <p>I am also more than a web developer. I am adventurous. I like trying new things and seeing new places. Whether it be traveling to some far off land, or trying exotic foods, I like to learn and experience all that I can. I like photography, I speak Spanish and I love to cook. I have been known to kick back and have a cigar, and I make one mean mojito. 
   </p>   

   <p>I recently graduated from Dev Bootcamp. I learned more in my time there than I thought was possible. I learned how to be a self-sufficient developer and solve problems quickly and on my own.  I learned the importance of writing readable, maintainable code through the use of testing and encapsulation.
   </p>   

   <p>My final project at Dev Bootcamp solved a problem. My group created an algorithm that would parse a human genome and find genetic risk factors for various diseases within that specific genome. We used a Ruby on Rails backend with ActiveRecord, and tied that to a NoSQL database in order to improve speed. It was challenging dealing with such a large dataset and the problems that arise with sending that amount of data across the web. In this project I learned the benefits of NoSQL vs SQL and was able to improve on database design and Ruby. 
   </p> 

   <p><h1 class="cover_letter_title">Let's talk about Avvo.</h1></p>

   <p><span class="italic">You care about what you do.</span> Looking over your open source projects, I noticed that there is an emphasis put on testing. Dev Bootcamp taught me to value building software the right way -- not just piecing something together that works, but truly embracing TDD. I would love to be part of a culture that is focused on building quality products through TDD and continuous integration.</p>

   <p><span class="italic">You're doing important work.</span> Avvoâ€™s mission to share information about a less than transparent industry is something that I truly value. You empower people to make more educated decisions about important matters, and therefore raise the bar, pun intended, for their legal counsel. I feel that this something that is important and that I want to contribute to.</p>

   <p><span class="italic">You don't take yourselves too seriously.</span> You are serious about you product, but you understand that by not burning out your employees you are creating a sustainable workplace. Happy employees are productive employees, and a company that cares for its employees is one that gets their employees' passion to work hard.<p>

   <p><span class="italic">I think we should work together.</span> You need someone who is willing to work hard to help your company grow. You need a developer who is willing to learn multiple technologies and be versatile as technology constantly changes. You need someone who wants to grow as an employee as your company grows. I'll leave you with one final haiku:</p>
