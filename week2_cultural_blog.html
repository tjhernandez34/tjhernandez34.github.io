<h1>When you think of the times in your life where you’ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</h1>
<p>In my life, the values that come to mind, when I have experienced the feeling above, are challenge, commitment, and Inner harmony.</p>
<p>Challenge is something I value because to me pushing yourself to the limits of what you are capable of is using your potential to its fullest extent. Wasted potential is not what you want to look back on your life and feel. Also, complacency doesn’t help one grow as a person, however, challenge does. With respect to challenge, commitment and inner harmony I feel like I am constantly trying to live up to these values. I am constantly trying to learn new things, such as coding, and to learn is to challenge yourself to grow. This growth, leads to completeness, which creates inner harmony (at least for me).</p>
<p>The last time someone asked me for advice, it was in regards to a corporate buyout of minority shareholders in their company in order to have better consensus on voting matters.</p>
