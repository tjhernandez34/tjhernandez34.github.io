   <p><h1 class="cover_letter_title">Hello, I'm Travis.</h1>
   <h2>I speak geek</h2>      
   <h2>AND human.</h2>
   <h2>I would love to meet you.</h2></p>

   <p><h1 class="cover_letter_title">Who am I?</h1></p>

   <p>I am a creator. I am a builder. I am a web developer. I take an idea and run with it. I build apps that serve a purpose, look good, and are easy to use. I understand that in order for an application to be successful, form and function are not mutually exclusive. I recognize the difference between forcing a framework to fit a problem, and finding the framework that is best for the problem. I am not afraid of trying new technologies.
   </p>   

   <p>I am also more than a web developer. I am adventurous. I like trying new things and seeing new places. Whether it be traveling to some far off land, or trying exotic foods, I like to learn and experience all that I can. I like photography, I speak Spanish and I love to cook. I have been known to kick back and have a cigar, and I make one mean mojito. 
   </p>   

   <p>I recently graduated from Dev Bootcamp. I learned more in my time there than I thought was possible. I learned how to be a self-sufficient developer and solve problems quickly and on my own.  I learned the importance of writing readable, maintainable code through the use of testing and encapsulation.
   </p>   

   <p>My final project at Dev Bootcamp solved a problem. My group created an algorithm that would parse a human genome and find genetic risk factors for various diseases within that specific genome. We used a Ruby on Rails backend with ActiveRecord, and tied that to a NoSQL database in order to improve speed. It was challenging dealing with such a large dataset and the problems that arise with sending that amount of data across the web. In this project I learned the benefits of NoSQL vs SQL and was able to improve on database design and Ruby.

   <p><h1 class="cover_letter_title">Let's talk about Kotis</h1></p>

   <p><span class="italic">You care about what you do.</span> Your website communicates effectively. The user interface is intuitive, and is easy to use. One thing that is important to me is working with people who care about the quality of their work. Dev Bootcamp taught me to value building software the right way. Not just piecing something together that works, but truly embracing TDD. I would love to be part of a culture that is focused on building the quality of product that Kotis creates.</p>

   <p><span class="italic">You care about your employees.</span> One of the things that was most important at Dev Bootcamp was our weekly feedback to our instructors and to the program. I watched the video about your feedback program on your site and it really impressed me. That was one of the things that I think made Dev Bootcamp so special, and the fact that you use a similar technique is really forward-thinking. It helps foster a level of comfort within an organization, and the willingness for you to take action on the feedback you receive can only be beneficial to everyone involved.</p>

   <p><span class="italic">I think we should work together.</span> You need someone who is willing to work hard to help your company grow. You need a developer who is willing to learn multiple technologies and be versatile. You need someone who wants to grow as an employee as your company grows.</p></p>
