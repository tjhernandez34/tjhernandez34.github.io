				<p>Iâ€™m a learner. Learning is one of the things I value most in life. Whether it is on a professional or personal level, it is important that a person improves their skill set and grows.</p>
				
				<p>For the last few months, I have put everything I have into learning to be a computer programmer. As with all things, you deal with success and also failures, but it is the times that you fail that you are able to learn and become better at what you do.</p>

				<p>This is an important lesson to take with you in life and I feel my ability to keep going until I accomplish what I want to accomplish is what sets me apart as an individual. I hate failure more than I like success, and I work incredibly hard to put everything I can into the things I am passionate about.</p>

				<p>I want to become the best developer that I can be, while also continuously learning new technologies and techniques in order to fulfill this goal.</p>
