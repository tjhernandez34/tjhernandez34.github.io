<p>Hello everyone! My name is Travis Hernandez and I am from Burlington, Washington. It is a small town about 70 miles north of Seattle. Currently, I call Seattle my home. I have always wanted to learn how computers work, but instead of studying this at university, I double majored in International Business and Foreign Language/International Affairs.</p>
<p>On one hand, it was good because it furthered my interest in other cultures and people. This led me to travel the world. Through this journey, I reevaluated what I needed to be happy, and that would be a career that was innovative and challenging.</p>
<p>This brings me back to computer programming. After my experiences, I now see learning programming as similar to learning a foreign language. For the last two years, I have lived in Spain. My Spanish improved immensely by being immersed in the language and culture. Now, I am comfortable and confident with the language. My experience has taught me that complete immersion is the most successful way to learn a new language, therefore in order to learn the language of computers, complete immersion is not only helpful, but necessary.</p>
<p>I liked the way that learning Spanish enabled me to communicate with people who did not speak English and I like the idea that writing code can cross all cultural and communication boundaries.</p>
