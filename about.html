		<p>Iâ€™m a learner. Learning is one of the things I value most in life. Whether it is on a professional or personal
			level, it is important that a person improves their skill set and grows.</p>
	
		<p>Currently, I am a software development engineer at Pluralstack, a software consulting company that specializes in the
			healthcare industry. I have been working on a small team, which is developing a new set of products for a few major
			healthcare companies. It has been a blast, and I am looking forward to my continued growth as an engineer.</p>
	
		<p>One thing I love about software development is that you always get to learn new technologies. The stuff that I have
			been working with lately has been mostly Angular and ReactJS.</p>
