<h1>Dynamics of Pairing Sessoions</h1>
<p>One of the most rewarding parts of Dev Bootcamp for me has been the pairing sessions. Granted they give me anxiety attacks ahead of time because I still don’t know everyone or what to expect going into each session, but so far they have gone well. It has been nice to pair with others who are in the same boat as me, both in terms of how they are feeling about their education in DBC and also being around others who are passionate about coding.</p>
<p>I rather like pairing with others because I enjoy collaboration and the way it helps me come up with new ways of problem solving when you have another person to bounce ideas off of. I feel like it helps in the creative solution process because two heads are better than one. Pairing sessions are also fun just because it’s nice to not be solely responsible for the outcome, meaning if I would have been doing it wrong alone that there is someone there to say “Hold on a sec, that doesn’t seem right.” This helps to save time in the overall project and prevents long periods of refactoring at the end.</p>
<p>One thing that has been kind of frustrating or difficult is the driver/navigator dynamic. Having been both driver and navigator, I don’t like doing just one or the other in a pairing session. I think the best is just going back and forth with thought process and typing because some people know pieces of code better than others and this way both people can play to their strengths in a faster manner. For example, if my syntax knowledge of array methods isn’t as strong as my partners, and I am navigating, rather than wait for me to come up with a solution to tell them to type, they just type what they know and then ask how it looks. I think though, that in the long run the process will become easier to manage as everyone’s syntax knowledge increases. Ultimately, I enjoy the sessions. To me the pros definitely outweigh the cons and I am looking forward to become more comfortable in this type of situation.</p>
<h1>Feedback and My Relationship with It</h1>
<p>I have felt encouraged by the feedback that I have received. It has mostly been positive, with just a fewthings to work on mixed in. The feedback definitely has made me go back and review the things that were mentioned within. I think hearing the areas where I am weak helps to make me a stronger coder because without hearing the areas where you struggled it’s hard to know where to begin to improve. From the feedback, I try to use it as a means of preparation for my next code session. It kind of reminds me of the things you learn through sports. One of the things that stuck with me is from my college baseball coach, and that is “Get better every day.” I think the feedback helps in showing me the steps I need to take in order to accomplish the goal of getting better every day.</p>
<p>Writing feedback was kind of difficult. I have been lucky, as I have yet to experience an awful pairing session (knock on wood). This means that coming up with positive things to say about my partners has been easy, however positive comments doesn’t necessarily help someone improve their work. Normally, in an area where I had more experience I would be critical (in a nice way) of how a problem was solved and then explain why it is easier to do it another way. However, in coding I am neither experienced enough nor in any sort of ‘coach’ position to make those assertions. This has been difficult for me because I know how important it is to know the areas you need improvement. I just wish I could definitively tell someone that to help them get better.</p>
<p>In the end, I think pairing coupled with feedback is a good way to learn. Once everyone gets more comfortable with the concepts and syntax I think the feedback will become more valuable to our growth both professionally as coders and also as people because it will teach us ways of improving our 
interpersonal skills.</p>

<h1>When you think of the times in your life where you have been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</h1>
<p>In my life, the values that come to mind, when I have experienced the feeling above, are challenge, commitment, and Inner harmony.</p>
<p>Challenge is something I value because to me pushing yourself to the limits of what you are capable of is using your potential to its fullest extent. Wasted potential is not what you want to look back on your life and feel. Also, complacency doesn’t help one grow as a person, however, challenge does. With respect to challenge, commitment and inner harmony I feel like I am constantly trying to live up to these values. I am constantly trying to learn new things, such as coding, and to learn is to challenge yourself to grow. This growth, leads to completeness, which creates inner harmony (at least for me).</p>
<p>The last time someone asked me for advice, it was in regards to a corporate buyout of minority shareholders in their company in order to have better consensus on voting matters.</p>
