<h1>Issues In Tech</h1>
<p>For 2014, one of the biggest issues facing the tech industry is the US Supreme Court case of Alice Corp v. CLS Bank. Even though everyone has heard of this landmark case, I am going to give you a summary of what it is about and what is at stake. Then I will discuss some of the implications of the various outcomes and what this would mean for the tech industry as a whole.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This case regards patent infringement. Alice Corp owns the patents for a handful of computer programs and electronic processes centered on financial trading systems. Alice Corp applied for these patents between 1992 and 2005 and they were finally issued between 1999 and 2010. In 2002, CLS Bank began using a similar software program to the ones Alice Corp holds patents for. The patents contain abstract ideas of how to facilitate the process of reducing risk for financial transactions and then the programs written in order to carry-out this system. Alice Corp found out about the violations and notified CLS Bank that they were infringing on the patents, and discussed licensing the software and systems to CLS Bank.</p>
<p>In 2007, CLS Bank sued Alice Corp in one of the lower levels of the US court system. They claimed that the patents held by Alice Corp were invalid and not enforceable. Alice Corp then countersued CLS Bank claiming that they had violated the patents they held. CLS Bank won this hearing, the court found that the patent held abstract ideas on “risk management”, that anyone in business or finance would know and that the program only electronically facilitated carrying out the ideas of risk management. Therefore they weren’t eligible for patents under 35 U.S.C. § 101.</p>
<p>Alice Corp later appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and had the earlier ruling overturned. CLS Bank filed a petition of appeal in the US Court of Appeals, and this overturned the courts’ prior ruling. This resulted in the court wanting to answer a few questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What test should the court use to determine if a computer based program is a patent-ineligible abstract idea?</li>
  <li>Will the presence of a computer in a claim eventually make the patent-ineligible material patentable?</li>
  <li>Should method, system, and media claim be equal under 35 U.S.C. § 101?</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, this leads to today with the US Supreme Court. The court has set out to answer this question: "Whether claims to computer-implemented inventions—including claims to systems and machines, processes, and items of manufacture—are directed to patent-eligible subject matter within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. § 101." Essentially, does the computer program you wrote, do something that people in a specific field view as common knowledge or a common goal.</p>
<h2>What is at stake and what are the implications?</h2>
<p>The main thing that is at stake is companies’ ability to create new, innovative products without threat of legal recourse. Lots of companies hold patents to various ideas even though they don’t have a product to go with the idea. This can lead to litigation for software companies because if have a similar idea and develop it, they will be susceptible to be sued. On the other, large companies that hold many patents are concerned that if the courts rule against Alice Corp, their patents might become invalid, creating lots of competition where before there was none.
It is also interesting to note that some of the major technology players, such as Google, Microsoft, IBM, Verizon, and HP, have filed friend of the court briefs for one of the two companies involved in the suit. All of the companies listed here, aside from IBM, are in support of CLS Bank.
In my opinion, I think it will be best if the court sides with CLS Bank. I think that this is an important action because if they end up siding with Alice Corp I feel it will stifle innovation and progress. However, I believe the court will find some middle-ground between the two sides in order to ensure patents are respected, but more so for the hardware and physical aspect of the tech industry (gadgets and such). This would keep the flow of new technology open and yet still allow firms to maintain ownership of the delivery devices for the programs.</p>

<h1>Emotional Conflict</h1>
<p>The last time I had a serious emotional conflict with someone was about a year ago. I look back on this one and kind of laugh because it was almost like a break-up, but with a co-worker. Anyways, I was working at a school in Spain. One of my coworkers, we will call him Juan, had slowly become one of my friends. He was still a coworker, but the kind of coworker where you joke around at work and then never see them outside of work. He would give me a ride to the school every day, along with the other non-Spaniards who taught English like I did.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, he would be late to pick us up or go in early, so we would end up taking the bus. One day, this happened, so we went to school like normal. Then as the day went on, he never came to work. Eventually, one of the other teachers told us that he sprained his ankle, so he wouldn’t be coming in that day. The next day came and went, same thing. The teachers told us he would be in by the end of the week.</p>
<p>As the days came and went he still was out with a sprained ankle. Then as days turned to a weeks, the staff informed us that he would be out for about 6 weeks with his ankle sprain. A couple of weeks after the accident, I sent him a text to see how he was doing. I didn’t get a response until two weeks later. He said he was feeling better and had just finished rehab, then went on to say he was really disappointed with me, but we could talk more after spring break when he came back to work. </p>
<p>Once he came back to work, he explained that he waited the two weeks to text me back because I had waited two weeks to text him. Then said that he didn’t want to be friends anymore and go to a colleagues-only relationship. He also said that he would no longer be giving the English language assistants a ride to work because he just wasn’t interested in doing it anymore. I told him I was sorry for hurting his feelings, and that if I knew it would be like this I would have contacted him sooner. I told him I respected his decision and that it was his decision to make, but if he ever felt differently I would still like to be friends. We shook hands and that was that. </p>
<p>Some things irritated me about this whole thing. First, I did not like how he was punishing the other English teachers for a conflict between him and me. Second, I did not like how he rescinded his statement of not giving the other English teachers a ride, by selectively giving, ones whom he wanted to, a ride to work. Essentially, punishing the ones whom I was closest with. </p>
<p>Looking back on this situation about a year removed, I would say my actions did not help the situation, but they also did not worsen it. If I could go back, I would send him a message to ask how he was doing and then we would probably still be friends. I think I learned a lot from this situation. I learned how different two cultures can be and what the social norms are. Even in the US, one should reasonably expect to get a how are you doing text if something happens to them, so that was my bad for not doing that. However, an American who sprains their ankle is not going to miss 6 weeks of work to recover. Maybe two days, maybe, unless your job requires you to be walking around, carrying things all day long. Teaching can be done from crutches, so I don’t want to give a pity party to someone that seems to be milking something for all it’s worth. </p>
<p>I don’t have conflict all that often in my life, aside from the occasional disagreement with my girlfriend, but this conflict is one that still sticks with me and I have learned that sometimes people just need a small gesture of kindness and then they will be happy.</p>

<h1>Dynamics of Pairing Sessoions</h1>
<p>One of the most rewarding parts of Dev Bootcamp for me has been the pairing sessions. Granted they give me anxiety attacks ahead of time because I still don’t know everyone or what to expect going into each session, but so far they have gone well. It has been nice to pair with others who are in the same boat as me, both in terms of how they are feeling about their education in DBC and also being around others who are passionate about coding.</p>
<p>I rather like pairing with others because I enjoy collaboration and the way it helps me come up with new ways of problem solving when you have another person to bounce ideas off of. I feel like it helps in the creative solution process because two heads are better than one. Pairing sessions are also fun just because it’s nice to not be solely responsible for the outcome, meaning if I would have been doing it wrong alone that there is someone there to say “Hold on a sec, that doesn’t seem right.” This helps to save time in the overall project and prevents long periods of refactoring at the end.</p>
<p>One thing that has been kind of frustrating or difficult is the driver/navigator dynamic. Having been both driver and navigator, I don’t like doing just one or the other in a pairing session. I think the best is just going back and forth with thought process and typing because some people know pieces of code better than others and this way both people can play to their strengths in a faster manner. For example, if my syntax knowledge of array methods isn’t as strong as my partners, and I am navigating, rather than wait for me to come up with a solution to tell them to type, they just type what they know and then ask how it looks. I think though, that in the long run the process will become easier to manage as everyone’s syntax knowledge increases. Ultimately, I enjoy the sessions. To me the pros definitely outweigh the cons and I am looking forward to become more comfortable in this type of situation.</p>
<h1>Feedback and My Relationship with It</h1>
<p>I have felt encouraged by the feedback that I have received. It has mostly been positive, with just a fewthings to work on mixed in. The feedback definitely has made me go back and review the things that were mentioned within. I think hearing the areas where I am weak helps to make me a stronger coder because without hearing the areas where you struggled it’s hard to know where to begin to improve. From the feedback, I try to use it as a means of preparation for my next code session. It kind of reminds me of the things you learn through sports. One of the things that stuck with me is from my college baseball coach, and that is “Get better every day.” I think the feedback helps in showing me the steps I need to take in order to accomplish the goal of getting better every day.</p>
<p>Writing feedback was kind of difficult. I have been lucky, as I have yet to experience an awful pairing session (knock on wood). This means that coming up with positive things to say about my partners has been easy, however positive comments doesn’t necessarily help someone improve their work. Normally, in an area where I had more experience I would be critical (in a nice way) of how a problem was solved and then explain why it is easier to do it another way. However, in coding I am neither experienced enough nor in any sort of ‘coach’ position to make those assertions. This has been difficult for me because I know how important it is to know the areas you need improvement. I just wish I could definitively tell someone that to help them get better.</p>
<p>In the end, I think pairing coupled with feedback is a good way to learn. Once everyone gets more comfortable with the concepts and syntax I think the feedback will become more valuable to our growth both professionally as coders and also as people because it will teach us ways of improving our 
interpersonal skills.</p>

<h1>When you think of the times in your life where you have been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</h1>
<p>In my life, the values that come to mind, when I have experienced the feeling above, are challenge, commitment, and Inner harmony.</p>
<p>Challenge is something I value because to me pushing yourself to the limits of what you are capable of is using your potential to its fullest extent. Wasted potential is not what you want to look back on your life and feel. Also, complacency doesn’t help one grow as a person, however, challenge does. With respect to challenge, commitment and inner harmony I feel like I am constantly trying to live up to these values. I am constantly trying to learn new things, such as coding, and to learn is to challenge yourself to grow. This growth, leads to completeness, which creates inner harmony (at least for me).</p>
<p>The last time someone asked me for advice, it was in regards to a corporate buyout of minority shareholders in their company in order to have better consensus on voting matters.</p>
