	<p class="lead">Welcome, I'm Travis. Building software is my passion. Being able to start with nothing and turn it into an awesome experience for a user is empowering. I thrive on the satisfaction of solving all of the problems that stand in the way of a finished product. I am passionate about building software because I always get the opportunity to learn new things, and learning is something I love to do.</p>
	
	<p class="lead" >Right now, I am a software engineer at InfoSpace in Bellevue, Washington. In the pst I have done various freelance projects, as well as hacking on some of my own projects.</p>

	<p class="lead" >I am into learning new technologies, so if there is something new and exciting out there I definitely want to play with it and try and find practical applications for its use. Over the past few months I have had the opportunity to learn Golang, which has been a blast.</p>
