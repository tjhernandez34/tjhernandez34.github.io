			<p>Welcome, I'm Travis. Building software is my passion. I love the way you can take nothing and turn it into something. I also enjoy figuring out how to solve all of the problems that stand between me and a finished product. I am passionate about being a developer because I always get the opportunity to learn new things, and learning is something I love to do.</p>
			
			<p>Currently, I am a web developer contractor for Infospace/Blucora, but in my freetime I have been building a web and mobile based app for Zach Lyon Creative based out of Reno, Nevada. The app uses a tech stack of Angular.js and Ionic for the front end applications with a Firebase, NoSQL, backend.</p>
