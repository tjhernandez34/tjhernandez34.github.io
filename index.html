			<p class="lead">Welcome, I'm Travis. Building software is my passion. Being able to start with nothing and turn it into an awesome experience for a user is empowering. I thrive on the satisfaction of solving all of the problems that stand in the way of a finished product. I am passionate about being a developer because I always get the opportunity to learn new things, and learning is something I love to do.</p>
			
			<p class="lead" >Right now, I am a software engineer at InfoSpace in Bellevue, Washington, but in my freetime I have been building a web and mobile based apps for Zach Lyon Creative based out of Reno, Nevada, as well as hacking away at some of my own projects on the side.</p>

			<p class="lead" >I am into learning new technologies, so if there is something new and exciting out there I definitely want to play with it and try and find practical applications for its use. The last few things I have been tinkering with are Golang and the Flask framework for Python.</p>
