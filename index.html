			<p>Welcome, I'm Travis. I love to make things. The satisfaction derived from creating something out of nothing is one of the joys I take from life. Whether it's in the kitchen or in front of a screen, it's something I love to do. I learned to program with Ruby and JavaScript, but I am always looking to learn new technologies.</p>
			
			<p>Currently, I'm building an iOS app in Objective-C to accompany a Rails based site and API that I created for a property management company.</p>
