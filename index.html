			<p>Welcome, I'm Travis. I love to make things. The satisfaction derived from creating something out of nothing is one of the joys I take from life. Whether it's in the kitchen or in front of a screen, it's something I love to do. I learned to program with Ruby and JavaScript, but I am always looking to learn new technologies.</p>
			
			<p>Currently, I'm building a web and mobile based app, using a tech stack of Angular.js and Ionic for the front end applications with a Firebase, NoSQL, backend for a creative design firm .</p>
